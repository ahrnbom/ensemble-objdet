Ensembling methods for object detection.

"""
General Ensemble - find overlapping boxes of the same class and average their positions
while adding their confidences. Can weigh different detectors with different weights.
No real learning here, although the weights and iou_thresh can be optimized.

Input:
 - dets : List of detections. Each detection is all the output from one detector, and
          should be a list of boxes, where each box should be on the format
          [box_x, box_y, box_w, box_h, class, confidence] where box_x and box_y
          are the center coordinates, box_w and box_h are width and height resp.
          The values should be floats, except the class which should be an integer.

 - iou_thresh: Threshold in terms of IOU where two boxes are considered the same,
               if they also belong to the same class.

 - weights: A list of weights, describing how much more some detectors should
            be trusted compared to others. The list should be as long as the
            number of detections. If this is set to None, then all detectors
            will be considered equally reliable. The sum of weights does not
            necessarily have to be 1.

Output:
    A list of boxes, on the same format as the input. Confidences are in range 0-1.
